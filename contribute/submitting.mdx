description: Step-by-step guide to adding your project to Awesome OpenCode
---

Follow these steps to submit your project, plugin, theme, agent, or resource to Awesome OpenCode.

## Prerequisites

Before submitting, ensure:
- You have a GitHub account
- Your project is publicly accessible
- Your repository has been active within the last 6 months
- You've reviewed the [contribution guidelines](/contribute/guidelines)

## Submission Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the Repository">
    Fork the `awesome-opencode` repository to your GitHub account:

    ```bash
    # Navigate to GitHub and fork the repository
    # https://github.com/awesome-opencode/awesome-opencode
    ```

    Then clone your fork locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-opencode.git
    cd awesome-opencode
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Branch">
    Create a descriptive branch name for your submission:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b add-my-project-name
    ```

    Use a branch name that describes what you're adding, for example:
    - `add-security-agent`
    - `add-dark-ocean-theme`
    - `add-database-mcp-server`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose the Correct Category">
    Determine which category folder your entry belongs in:

    - `data/plugins/` - OpenCode plugins and extensions (JS/TS modules)
    - `data/themes/` - Color schemes and visual themes
    - `data/agents/` - AI agents and skills
    - `data/projects/` - Standalone tools, GUIs, integrations
    - `data/resources/` - Guides, templates, configurations, MCP servers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your YAML File">
    Create a new YAML file with a kebab-case name in the appropriate category folder:

    ```bash
    # Example for a plugin
    touch data/plugins/my-plugin-name.yaml
    ```

    **File naming conventions:**
    - Use lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case)
    - Be descriptive but concise
    - Match your project name when possible
    - Use `.yaml` extension (not `.yml`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Required Fields">
    Open your YAML file and add the four required fields:

    ```yaml
    name: Your Project Name
    repo: https://github.com/owner/repo-name
    tagline: Short description under 120 characters
    description: Longer description explaining what it does and why it's useful.
    ```

    See the [Schema Reference](/contribute/schema-reference) for all available fields.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Optional Fields">
    Enhance your entry with optional fields:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```yaml With Installation Instructions
    name: Database MCP Server
    repo: https://github.com/example/mcp-database
    tagline: MCP server for database access and querying
    description: A Model Context Protocol server for database access.
    
    scope:
      - global
      - project
    
    tags:
      - mcp-server
      - database
      - postgresql
    
    min_version: "1.0.0"
    
    homepage: https://example.com/docs
    
    installation: |
      ## Prerequisites
      - Node.js 18+
      - Database credentials
      
      ## Installation
      ```bash
      npm install -g @example/mcp-database
      ```
      
      ## Configuration
      Add to `opencode.json`:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "database": {
            "command": "mcp-database",
            "args": ["--connection", "postgresql://localhost/db"]
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    ```

    ```yaml Minimal Entry
    name: Simple Theme
    repo: https://github.com/example/simple-theme
    tagline: A minimalist dark theme for OpenCode
    description: Clean, distraction-free dark theme with subtle syntax highlighting.
    
    scope:
      - global
    
    tags:
      - dark
      - minimal
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Your Entry">
    Run the validation script to ensure your YAML is valid:

    ```bash
    npm install
    node scripts/validate.js data/category/your-file.yaml
    ```

    The validator checks:
    - YAML syntax is correct
    - Required fields are present
    - Field types match the schema
    - Tagline is 120 characters or less
    - URLs are valid
    - Version format is correct (if specified)

    <Warning>
    Fix all validation errors before submitting. GitHub Actions will automatically validate your submission and reject invalid entries.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Commit Your Changes">
    Add and commit your new YAML file:

    ```bash
    git add data/category/your-file.yaml
    git commit -m "docs: add your-project-name to category"
    ```

    Use a clear commit message that follows the pattern:
    - `docs: add project-name to plugins`
    - `docs: add theme-name to themes`
    - `docs: add agent-name to agents`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push to Your Fork">
    Push your branch to your GitHub fork:

    ```bash
    git push origin add-my-project-name
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open a Pull Request">
    1. Go to the [awesome-opencode repository](https://github.com/awesome-opencode/awesome-opencode)
    2. Click "Pull requests" → "New pull request"
    3. Click "compare across forks"
    4. Select your fork and branch
    5. Create the pull request with a clear title

    **PR title examples:**
    - "Add Security Agent to agents"
    - "Add Dark Ocean Theme to themes"
    - "Add Database MCP Server to resources"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Review">
    A maintainer will review your submission:

    - **Automated checks** run first (validation, formatting)
    - **Manual review** follows (relevance, quality, completeness)
    - You may receive **feedback** requesting changes
    - Once approved, your entry is **merged**
    - The **README.md automatically updates** to include your entry

    Response time is typically 1-3 days.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Your PR is Merged

Once merged:
- Your entry appears in the main README.md
- The Awesome OpenCode list is updated
- Your project gains visibility in the OpenCode community

<Warning>
Do NOT edit README.md directly. It is automatically generated from the YAML files. Your changes will be overwritten.
</Warning>

## Updating Your Entry

To update an existing entry:

1. Follow the same fork and branch process
2. Edit your existing YAML file in `data/category/`
3. Update the fields that need changes
4. Validate, commit, and submit a new PR
5. Use a commit message like `docs: update project-name description`

## Common Issues

### Validation Fails

If validation fails:
- Read the error message carefully
- Check the [Schema Reference](/contribute/schema-reference) for field requirements
- Ensure tagline is ≤ 120 characters
- Verify repository URL is valid and accessible
- Confirm all required fields are present

### PR is Declined

Common reasons for declined PRs:
- Project is not relevant to OpenCode
- Repository has not been updated in 6+ months
- Entry is a duplicate
- Required fields are missing or incomplete
- Poor quality description or documentation

Review the [guidelines](/contribute/guidelines) and resubmit with improvements.
