description: Requirements and quality standards for submitting entries to Awesome OpenCode
---

Thank you for contributing to Awesome OpenCode! This guide outlines the requirements and standards for high-quality submissions.

## Entry Requirements

All submissions must meet these requirements:

- **Relevant** - Directly related to OpenCode (plugins, themes, agents, tools, guides, etc.)
- **Public** - Repository must be publicly accessible
- **Maintained** - Active commits within the last 6 months
- **Unique** - Not a duplicate of an existing entry
- **Complete** - All required fields included and validated

<Warning>
Entries that don't meet these requirements will be declined during review.
</Warning>

## Quality Standards

### Clear Naming

Your entry name should be:
- Descriptive and specific
- Title case (e.g., "Security Review Agent" not "security-review-agent")
- Free of marketing buzzwords
- Accurately reflect what the project does

### Compelling Tagline

The tagline is shown in collapsed view and must:
- Be 120 characters or less
- Clearly explain what your project does
- Be concise and punchy
- Avoid redundant words (don't repeat the category name)

**Good examples:**
- "AI agent specialized in security code review"
- "Web-based dashboard for monitoring OpenCode sessions"
- "MCP server for database access and querying"

**Bad examples:**
- "The best plugin ever made" (vague, marketing-heavy)
- "A plugin" (not descriptive)
- "Plugin for OpenCode that does many things" (too generic)

### Comprehensive Description

Your description should:
- Explain what the project does in detail
- Highlight key features and use cases
- Explain why it's useful
- Can be multiple lines
- Use proper markdown formatting

### Accurate Repository Link

The `repo` field must:
- Link to a public GitHub repository (or other git hosting)
- Be the canonical source code location
- Use HTTPS format (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo`)
- Be a valid, accessible URL

## What Makes a Good Submission

### Complete Documentation

Provide detailed installation instructions in the `installation` field:
- Prerequisites clearly listed
- Step-by-step installation commands
- Configuration examples
- Files that will be modified
- Removal/uninstallation instructions

See the [Schema Reference](/contribute/schema-reference) for all available fields.

### Appropriate Category

Place your YAML file in the correct category folder:

- `data/plugins/` - OpenCode plugins and extensions (JS/TS modules)
- `data/themes/` - Color schemes and visual themes
- `data/agents/` - AI agents and skills for specialized tasks
- `data/projects/` - Standalone tools, GUIs, integrations, and utilities
- `data/resources/` - Guides, templates, configurations, and MCP servers

<Warning>
If you're unsure which category fits best, choose the one that represents the primary purpose. For example, an MCP server goes in `resources/`, not `projects/`.
</Warning>

### Proper Scope

Use the `scope` field to indicate where your extension can be installed:

- `global` - System-wide installation (`~/.config/opencode/`)
- `project` - Project-specific installation (`.opencode/`)
- Both - Can be installed in either location

If omitted, defaults to `[global]`.

### Helpful Tags

Add relevant tags to improve discoverability:
- Be specific (e.g., "postgresql", "security", "code-review")
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word tags
- Include technology names if applicable
- Avoid overly generic tags

### Version Requirements

If your project requires a specific OpenCode version, specify it:

```yaml
min_version: "1.0.0"
```

Use semantic versioning format (major.minor.patch).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Editing README.md directly** - Never edit the README. It auto-generates from YAML files.
2. **Missing required fields** - Validation will fail without `name`, `repo`, `tagline`, and `description`.
3. **Tagline too long** - Must be 120 characters or less.
4. **Invalid repository URL** - Must be a valid HTTPS URL to a git repository.
5. **Poor file naming** - Use kebab-case (e.g., `my-plugin.yaml`, not `MyPlugin.yaml`).
6. **Unmaintained projects** - Ensure your repository has recent activity.

## Review Process

After you submit a pull request:

1. **Automated validation** - GitHub Actions runs schema validation on your YAML
2. **Maintainer review** - A maintainer reviews content, relevance, and quality
3. **Feedback or approval** - You may receive requests for changes
4. **Merge** - Once approved, your entry is merged
5. **README update** - The README.md automatically regenerates to include your entry

You don't need to update README.md manually - it's generated from the YAML files.

## Need Help?
