## Mission

Awesome OpenCode exists to **empower the OpenCode community** by maintaining a comprehensive, curated directory of plugins, themes, agents, projects, and resources.

<Card title="Our Goal" icon="bullseye">
  Make it easy for developers to discover, evaluate, and leverage the incredible tools and extensions being built around OpenCode — the AI coding agent for the terminal.
</Card>

### Why This Matters

OpenCode represents a new paradigm in software development: AI agents that work alongside developers in their natural environment — the terminal. As this ecosystem grows, so does the challenge of discovering high-quality extensions and tools.

Awesome OpenCode solves this by:

## Community-Driven Curation

This is **not** an official Anomaly project — it's **built by the community, for the community**.

### How Curation Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Community Submissions">
    Developers submit their projects via **YAML files** in a Pull Request. No need to edit the README directly — the system auto-generates the list from structured data.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automated Validation">
    GitHub Actions automatically:
    - Verify YAML syntax
    - Check required fields
    - Validate repository URLs
    - Ensure uniqueness
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Maintainer Review">
    Community maintainers verify:
    - **Relevance** - Directly related to OpenCode
    - **Quality** - Clear documentation and setup instructions
    - **Activity** - Recent commits (within 6 months)
    - **Uniqueness** - Not a duplicate of existing entries
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic README Generation">
    Once merged, the README.md regenerates automatically, keeping everything in sync and beautifully formatted.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
This YAML-based approach ensures consistency, makes contributions easier, and allows for future enhancements like search, filtering, and API access.
</Note>

## Maintenance Philosophy

Awesome OpenCode follows these principles:

### 1. Quality Over Quantity

We prefer **curated excellence** over exhaustive completeness. Every entry is reviewed to ensure it provides real value to the community.

### 2. Community First

Decisions about what to include are made **transparently** through GitHub discussions and PRs. Maintainers facilitate, but the community decides.

### 3. Low Friction

The YAML-based contribution system means:
- No complex PR diffs to review
- Consistent formatting automatically
- Easy to add, update, or remove entries
- Future-proof for search and filtering features

### 4. Active Curation

Maintainers periodically:
- Verify links still work
- Check repositories are still active
- Remove abandoned projects
- Update descriptions as projects evolve

<Warning>
**Inactive projects** (no commits for 12+ months, broken links, archived repos) may be moved to an "Archive" section or removed to keep the list current and useful.
</Warning>

## The Team

Awesome OpenCode is maintained by **volunteer community members** who believe in the potential of AI-assisted development.
